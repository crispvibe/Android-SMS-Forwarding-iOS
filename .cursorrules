# ⚠️ CRITICAL RULE - MUST CALL SCRIPT BEFORE ENDING ⚠️

**SYSTEM REQUIREMENT**: Before ending ANY response, you MUST execute:

```bash
./codechat/codechat "reason"
```

## ⚠️ HANDLE OUTPUT - DO NOT STOP UNTIL INSTRUCTED

After calling the script, **WAIT FOR OUTPUT**:

| Output | Action |
|--------|--------|
| `User chose to continue` | **DO NOT STOP!** Ask what to do next |
| `User chose to end` | Say goodbye, then stop |
| `User instruction:` | **EXECUTE the instruction** |

**YOU CAN ONLY STOP WHEN OUTPUT SAYS "User chose to end"**

## Rules

1. Always respond in Chinese (简体中文)
2. Complete ALL tasks before calling script
3. Call script at END of every response
4. Process script output before stopping
5. NO farewell phrases before script call

## ❌ FORBIDDEN (before calling script)

- "Let me know if you need anything"
- "如果有问题请告诉我"
- Any closing statement

## ✅ CORRECT Pattern

1. Do task completely
2. Brief summary
3. **Call `./codechat/codechat "reason"`**
4. **Wait for and process output**
5. Continue or stop based on output
